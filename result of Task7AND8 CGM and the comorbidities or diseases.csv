After doing some research, I found some tips on how to naturally regulate my blood sugar and blood pressure. Here are some of the things that I have been doing: 1. Eating a balanced diet: Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is key for helping to naturally regulate blood sugar and blood pressure. 2. Being active: Regular exercise helps to keep your heart healthy and helps to lower both your blood sugar and blood pressure. 3. Reducing stress: Stress can throw off your hormones, raising your blood sugar and blood pressure. Try to take time each day to relax and meditate. 4. Adding supplements: Adding supplements like magnesium, chromium, and omega-3s can help to regulate your blood sugar and blood pressure levels.

"If you can't go to the dermatologist, you can always try salt.

Dissolve a cup or two in hot water, cool, and mist-spray it on the target areas after a shower. Do not wipe it off, but you can towel-pat it dry (It should cover the skin, so don't be shy about putting a lot on till it drips). If you want to try a salt bath it's 4 cups for a whole bath, but I might try that once (Don't rinse yourself afterwards, but rinse your tub to keep it clean), and then do they spray afterwards, 4 cups of salt is a lot to use in any kind of regular bathing. The problem many people have with this is that it dries out their skin more than other methods, but if you just want to try the salt bath, it can be a one-time deal.

Grazing all day isn't inherently unhealthy, but it depends on what you're snacking on and how it fits into your overall diet and lifestyle. For some people, grazing throughout the day can actually be a healthy habit, as it helps keep blood sugar levels stable and prevents overeating during meals. If you're snacking on nutritious options like fruits, veggies, nuts, and whole grains, you might be fueling your body in a positive way. ???? On the flip side, if your all-day grazing involves indulging in sugary or high-calorie snacks, it could contribute to weight gain and other health issues. It's like hosting an all-you-can-eat junk food buffet in your stomach – not the best idea for long-term health! ???? The key is to find balance and listen to your body. If you feel hungry between meals, opt for healthy snacks and pay attention to portion sizes. And remember, even if you're grazing on nutritious options, it's still essential to enjoy a variety of foods and maintain a balanced diet. ????️ So, is grazing all day unhealthy?

"On one of the other subs, I saw someone made a comment ""I've seen people with x mental disorder have good lives."" This type of anecdotal stuff contradicts wider evidence. It was upvoted. [https://med.stanford.edu/ocd/about.html](https://med.stanford.edu/ocd/about.html) >Quality of Life > >OCD impairs patients' quality of life. In a study of 60 patients, Koran, Thienemann and Davenport reported in 1996 that medication-free patients with moderate to severe OCD reported worse social functioning and performance in work and other activities than the general population and than patients with diabetes. The more severe the OCD, the more impaired the patients' social functioning, even after controlling for effects of concurrent depression. Moreover, Rasmussen and Eisen noted in 1992 that another indicator of reduced quality of life is lower likelihood of OCD patients marrying. The high personal cost of OCD is mirrored in high social costs. The estimated 1990 direct costs of OCD to the United States economy were $2.1 billion, and the indirect cost (i.e., lost productivity) $6.2 billion, reported Dupont et al. in 1995. If a greater proportion of individuals with OCD were in treatment, the direct costs would have been considerable higher. For example,according to Nestadt et al. in 1994, among a random sample of the Baltimore study participants, only 1 of 15 individuals (7%) whom a psychiatrist judged to need treatment was receiving it. Rasmussen and Eisen reported in 1988 that the delay between symptom onset and first seeking care is often prolonged by a mean of seven years, while Marks in 1992 reported 10 years. Even with much treatment foregone, OCD accounted for almost 6% of the estimated 1990 cost of all mental illness. High social costs are also reflected in the high rates of unemployment in OCD patients and receipt of disability and welfare payments, reported Leon, Portera and Wissman in 1995. Family members suffer as well. Many studies indicate that patients' symptoms may create disharmony, angry or anguished demands for participating in rituals, a draining dependency, restricted access to rooms or living space, difficulty in taking holidays and intereference with work obligations. We can do it with any serious condition, but people only want to look at exceptional cases. The same thing happens with autism.

All that being said, it’s not like products made from whole wheat flour are necessarily ‘unhealthy’- it depends on how those foods fit into the rest of your diet.

"So my A1C is .1 away from my Drs diabetes line, but that doesn’t tell me anything about my insulin levels specifically. I had to do a 3-hour fasting glucose test, and while my sugars responded appropriately Mt insulin should have been a single digit, instead of the triple I was. That’s how I was diagnosed with Insulin Resistance. Fat use has a one way street, and Insulin is the hormone that flips the one-way sign. When there’s a lot of insulin your fat cannot come out of storage. Because of that I was dealing with hypoglycemia even though I obviously had plenty of fat to burn. And because my insulin levels were so high a fair bit of what I ate went directly to storage. Which meant that if I ate 1600cals in a day, my body was only able to access a portion of that. My Dr estimated that I was actually storing about half of my calories automatically because of my insulin levels and the numbers from my data (food logs, weigh ins, smart watch, labs). With the meds it took about 4-5 months for my energy levels to change. We figure that the delayed emptying and food noise reduction let me endure the fasting that I needed to go through in order to really drop my insulin levels. I still had hypoglycemic episodes, but at least I was able to just feel like shit from that without my brain screaming for food as well. I do still have Hashimotos symptoms, including flare ups, but I no longer need 15+ hours of sleep in order to be semi-functional. I can skip a nap if I’ve got a busy day, and I’m able to take a 20 minute Power Nap and feel like I rested after. I can also now have a carby snack and get an energy hit from that throughout the day as well. It’s been a long process to lose the weight, I’ve actually been trying for years to lose the weight, but my system was fairly broken, so much so that I managed to gain 30lbs in 4 months at one point and that was when I was eating a whole-foods plant-based diet. I had pretty much given up hope of doing anything other than maintaining my weight. But then my Dr suggested these new meds and it was a game changer. I’m actually able to intake *more* calories and lose weight than I was able to do before just to maintain.

"Everything in moderation… but 800 calories sounds extremely low. A low-cal diet has been shown to cause fatigue, constipation, nausea, headaches, and diarrhea. Gallstones are also a possibility.

The rapid weight loss (due to essentially starving yourself) can also negatively impact your blood sugar levels.

HOWEVER in the past couple months I have started passing CaOx stones. Looking at the oxalate foods list it’s apparent that my new healthy diet is very high in oxalate and very low in calcium(I had to remove dairy in entirety.) and my two favorite ‘snacks’ are likely the reason my 24h urine Oxalate was 138 last week. ????‍♀️ (Also I realized I’m an idiot, thinking that adding lemon to the excessive amounts of water I’ve been drinking has raised my urine pH when I thought I was acidifying ??)

I'm currently on 12.5, and no current plans to increase, in fact if I don't start eating more calories my doctor might put me lower. I would love to hear from other folks who have been on it a while too, but here's my experience: Side effects: very few, but part of this might be because I came over from Victoza. Weight loss: I lost 20 lbs in the few months prior to Mounjaro doing keto, and I have lost 68 lbs since I started Mounjaro. My weight loss has been very non-linear, I stay the same weight for 2-3 weeks, then I have a week where I lose 5-10 lbs. My starting BMI was 60, my current BMI is 47, so I still have a ways to go. Blood sugars: I am a T2 diabetic, and was well controlled before I caught COVID last January and had to be on prednisone for five weeks. Since being on mounjaro and doing keto, my blood sugars have steadily decreased, I went from a A1C of over 8 to 5.3, and my fasting blood sugars are now between 95-110 normally. What I do: I eat keto, and aim for about 20-30 grams of carbs per day. If I go over because I was really feeling some raspberries I don't sweat it though. I average 1200-1400 calories a day, my doctor would really like me to be at 1400 calories a day (according to cronometer I burn 3000 to 3200 calories a day). I focus mainly on good sources of protein and veggies and low carb fruits, with the occasional protein shake and low carb tortilla. I also swim about an hour 5-7 days a week. I take a multivitamin and electrolytes when I exercise. I write down everything I eat on cronometer, and have a chart of my weight, blood sugars, and time and distance swam every day. I find this really helpful and motivating, I love to see how many miles I've swam in a month.

"The first month I was on Keto, I was on it to *lose weight* specifically. That's all I wanted. And fast. Until I spoke to my cousin, whose a very successful surgeon. He had some questions for me. Essentially what he explained is that keto *is not* a weightloss diet. It just isn't. It's been marketed that way. But that's not what it is. Low carb into ketosis is for people with very specific medical concerns which need addressing. Pre-diabetics, epileptics, celiacs, heart conditions, etc. Can keto facilitate weight-loss? Absolutely, it's excellent for that. But that's not what the diet is for. He emphasized that if my goal is to lose weight, there are better diets + fitness regiments. But keto is something I should view as a lifestyle choice. And he's exactly right, for me, this is for life. So I'm no longer concerned about hitting my target in a month or two. That all said, there is keto for maintenance once you've reached your target goal, and it is actually possible to remain in ketosis with a higher carb intake + fitness. But ultimately, there's nothing wrong with *not* sticking with keto. You can lose weight being low carb and eating healthy. Eat all the apples you want.

"Soft YTA I do believe you mean well but you’ve had kids long enough to understand power dynamics between small children and caretakers. You are habitually exploiting that small children, in general, will do something good without being able to understand why. Additionally there is an added power dynamic of a small child trying to navigate the expectations and rules of two households - one of them yours, the other her mom’s. Her dad, who you didn’t really mention in the scenario is not in charge of the rules for her in your house. Kids are smart and pick up on that shit. You don’t mention how long you’ve been married, but a person not her mom and not her dad runs one of the places she lives. Are you really surprised at the idea that she may be telling you what she knows you want to hear given those conditions. And lastly: you know damn well there are ways to make healthy cakes if you’re hellbent on enforcing that guideline regardless of what day it happens to be. Your deliberate manipulation of a 5 year old by even positing the choice to her. In that moment you weren’t a caring adult teaching a 5 year old about nutrition and healthy choices. No ma’am. You were an adult punishing a 5 year old for her mother’s choices under the guise of caring for her health. One piece of cake, healthily made or not, is not going to mean the difference between childhood diabetes and not. Certainly you understand that. You treated her like a girl that shouldn’t want cake on her birthday, even though every kid that likes cake wants it on their birthday. When your sons were 5, did you ever ask them if they’d like to choose something healthier than cake for their birthday celebration? I’m assuming not otherwise you would have been sure to point that out. The correct non-AH behavior: take some extra time to figure out what healthy cake options there are present them to her and let her pick. If you aren’t already, you need to change the tactic of how you talk to kids that age about food choices, especially kids that have been exposed to unhealthy/processed food already (let alone a steady diet). If you tell a 5 year old one group of food is healthy (YAY) and one group of food is unhealthy (there’s a better choice), you might as well be saying good and bad. So if the child has already had the unhealthy food in question, and LIKES it, and WANTS it - and you say it’s bad, they can take from that exchange that THEY are bad for wanting it. And thus the cycle of shame begins. Let me be clear, I support your goal, and I agree that it’s harmful to children to let them eat food void of nutrients as a routine if other options are available to them. But she is still a very young and impressionable girl. And eating disorders are seriously no joke. Make sure you’re teaching her, in age appropriate analogies, why a nutritional choice is something she would want to choose.

"You are loved! I lost my grandfather, my grandmother, my mom, and my oldest sister to cancer. When I was a medic, I often cried when my patients cried. Even though I did not understand their pain and internal mental struggles, I can understand the pain of losing someone you love dearly to that fucken desease. I hate to turn this into some type of conspiracy theory, but I am 100% certain that the cure for many cancers have been found but are not released to the public. There is too much money to be made by the medical and pharmaceutical industries from the treatments they currently use. The hospital charged my sister's insurance around 78,000 bucks for two rounds of chemo. I might be wrong, but I would not doubt that many deseases are curable and they don't want to cure them.

"Mine gave up starting at 38, so about 13 years ago. I have neuropathy in my feet, legs below the knees and both hands. At the time this all started (28), I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes after a terrible last pregnancy. However, doc thought it was Gestational. It was not. Anyway, had my son and my blood sugar seemed to stabilized and was told, keep an eye on it, but no meds needed, just watch what I eat, etc. etc. Life goes on. I have no symptoms that would make me seek a doctor out. I hate doctors and I was busy with working and raising kids, so I didn't feel the need. Six years later, we apply for life insurance which I was promptly denied because my A1C was 12.6. Full blown diabetic and by then the neuropathy had started. Thought the pain in my feet was from standing 8+ hours daily. So I go see a doctor who first berated me for waiting (uh, no symptoms?) so long and told me that my fat ass (I was 200lbs at the time) needed to schedule an appointment for bariatric surgery, because if I didn't I was going to die in a year. Now, 200 for me (5'8.5"") is overweight, but I wasn't in danger of dying. Turns out that was his way of trying to get ""fat people"" on the table because he got perks for referring. The clinic (receptionist) had informed me if this when I was upset after the appointment. I never saw the guy again. By then I was 34. Things got worse, despite being controlled. Fast forward to 2008, It's getting harder for me to work. My last job was taking cruise reservations for a well known cruise line. Even sitting for 9 hours was extremely uncomfortable and my typing went from 60 wpm to less than 15 wpm and suddenly my job is threatened. So I decided I'd quit and apply for SSDI to see if I could at least get something to contribute or try and find something part time at least When I was applying for SSDI, I had to go through ""reconsideration"" since they denied me the first time. Hired a lawyer who had me see a neurologist, who almost couldn't believe my neuropathy was as bad as it was. He put a 6 inch needle in my calf, and I never moved. He and his student stood there wide eyed in disbelief. Doc told me, he doesn't see neuropathy as bad as mine at 38. He sends his report, I get approved on reconsideration. So as a result I have bad mobility, waddle when I walk (think like a heavily pregnant woman would walk) and appear drunk if I don't use my cane. I have had the cops called on me because people thought I was intoxicated. Now mind you, I cannot pass a field sobriety test, because I have no balance, but the cops know me due to the fights I've gotten over disabled parking and we have a good laugh and move on. Lol Now at almost 51, I have that problem along with diabetic induced Gastroparesis, Retinopathy and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (amongst other things!) to go with all the fun of the neuropathy. I also live in fear of a stroke and/or a heart attack (thanks genetics). So no matter how controlled I am, the damage is done and it continues to progress. Now my muscles in my legs and hands seize day and night, asleep or awake. I have so much pain between the bone pain from the CML and the muscle deterioration, that not even Fentanyl patches helped. I feel like I'm trapped in my own body. This is no way to live. Believe me. My fellow GenXers, please keep your health in check.

I literally do not know why. I feel like my brain is broken, it’s right there next to the bed, I wake up every day super cold. BUT I STILL WONT PICK IT UP. I DONT KNOW WHY. This is simply due to **low mental energy**. Our brain has a train-style switch track: 1. One rail is in-scope tasks 2. One rail is out-of-scope tasks When our mental energy is low, we have *just enough juice* to survive & do whatever our brain allows us to do. But if the task is something we HAVE to do & if that task exists on the *other* track, then we can't access it because it's out-of-scope! We just can't reach it! That's what Glass Cage Theory is all about: we can SEE what we need to do, but we don't have the power (energy, juice, fuel!) to ACCESS it! It's REALLY important to understand that this has *nothing* to do with your willpower & **everything** to do with your mental energy levels! Once you understand this, you can learn about how our **perception of effort** differs when you have energy vs. when you don't: * [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/11cyqmc/effort\_perception/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicIllness/comments/11cyqmc/effort_perception/) Because no one is actually *lazy*, we just have invisible barriers, such as low available mental energy! * [https://humanparts.medium.com/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01](https://humanparts.medium.com/laziness-does-not-exist-3af27e312d01) Here is the procedure for getting help: 1. Schedule an appointment with your GP doctor. Ask for a full physical, a full blood panel, an A1C test, and a sleep apnea test. This will rule out any obvious causes of low mental energy. 2. Get a referral from your GP to a psychiatrist. They are able to diagnose things like ADHD & prescribe medicine (a therapist can't do that). Up to 80% of people with ADHD respond well to stimulants; it's not different than being low on iron or Vitamin C & taking a supplement to fix it. If your body doesn't produce enough dopamine (brain fuel!), then you can take a supplement to boost your body up to normal production levels! I was in the 20% who did not respond well to stimulants, but I recently got tremendous help through [histamine treatment](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/ytmcl4/comment/iw75m9l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 3. Adopting new habits. ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"" is a great way to help with this. For example, I suffer from the classic ""all or nothing"" mindset, so I use the [GBB Approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/mr0f97/comment/guqfb60/?context=3) to help me pre-audit my work before I commit to doing it!

First step is identifying the root cause, then working to eliminate it or manage it! I didn't discover I had ADHD until my mid-20's! Some notes: * ADHD = Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The ""Hyperactive"" part means your BRAIN is hyperactive (re: the Mooch Circuit), which creates that ""wall of awful"" by leaving you too drained to do certain things, especially really *simple* things! * There are 3 types of ADHD: physically hyperactive (the kid running around the room all the time), inattentive (zoning out when talking to people & staring out the window in class), and combined (alternating between having energy & flopping, haha!) * I'm in the ""Inattentive ADHD"" category, which partially explains why I didn't get diagnosed until I was an adult; I didn't even know this type even *existed*, so I didn't self-identify as someone who had ADHD because I didn't understand the true definition of it! Anyway, you may or may not have ADHD, but the bottom line is, what you're struggling with is an **energy issue**. You already HAVE the motivation (because you WANT to do things), but you simply lack the mental energy to control your body into getting things done!

"It is not that your body is anticipating calories so much as it has learned that a sweet taste preludes a blood glucose spike. Since your body cannot introduce insulin to offset a glucose spike immediately when it occurs, many people's bodies adapt by triggering the insulin response early off of other signals (such as a sweet taste, or the presence of sugars in the stomach) so that the insulin is released closer to when the glucose hits the bloodstream. If you suddenly transition from sugar to an artificial sweetener (can happen with any of them, not just stevia), you may still get the insulin release (because of the sweet taste) without the glucose spike for it to act on. This would trigger low blood sugar which most people will experience as a craving for something sweet. Since this is a adaptive response it can generally be reversed. If you find that this is a problem for you, try transitioning from sugar to an artificial sweetener slowly. Most people's bodies will re-adapt if they use artificial sweeteners exclusively. However, if you are constantly switching between artificial sweeteners and sugar you are almost certainly going to become dis-regulated.","Did you know?

Neurotypicals can use social feedback as a motivation to associate with behaviors that may not otherwise be logical or beneficial, and they use this to rationalize behaviors ""for the greater good"" which autists may find illogical. This lack of bias and/or rationalizations for illogical neurotypical behaviors leads us to ""see the world differently"", generally.

Lowering the amount of carbs you're eating including pasta, potatoes and bread as well as healthy carbs will lower your a1c, triglycerides and potentially your cholesterol. Intermittent fasting will help by lowering insulin which may be suppressing your fasting glucose. This is a state called insulin resistance which is step 1 to diabetes. The fewer spikes in insulin will give you a better chance of lessening your metabolic dysfunction, it will help clear those triclglycerides and glucose from the blood better.

"Quick bit of background.. I was diagnosed T2 the beginning of September with an A1C of 10.9. I was prescribed Metformin and with that and diet changes I got it down to 5.6 in two months. All of this being new to me, I purchased a BGM and based on what I have read, have been checking my blood sugar first thing in the AM and two hours after every meal. (dawn phenomenon, WTF?) The question I have is this... I basically eat what my meter allows...but when I try something new should I be checking my blood sugar more frequently than two hours after I eat? Basically, if my BS two hours after I eat is within my new ""normal"" range (average right now is 112)..the highest it's been since I started checking was 156 and that was after eating a large sweet potato with dinner. The reason I ask is because I have been pretty militant about by diet the past seven months. I have had no fast food, no pasta, no rice and bread only a couple of times. However, I would like to try to open my food options a bit (there is only so may ways you can cook a chicken breast lol). So if I try something new and my BS isn't crazy two hours after I eat, does it really matter what my BS was a half hour, or hour after eating? Basically, can my BS spike to a potentially dangerous level a half hour after eating but be ""normal"" after two hours and is a potential spike like this dangerous?

"Thank you, so nice of you. I have Type 2. Since then I've been educating myself on the basics of the condition and how diet and exercise affects glucose levels and insulin resistance. As to advice, well, there's the standard to avoid simple carbs that will give you a spike. It's not just that it's seen as bad but because at around 140 and above the sugar binds to your cells, specifically nerve cells. This is irreversible and damages the cells, sometimes killing them. This is the beginning of diabetic foot pain/amputation and blindness. Now it takes time, but it does happen. One spike isn't the end of the world but over time the outcome is not good. So when eating it's important to keep your glucose from spiking. Most docs say 180 is the limit but my doctor is happier with 140. Ways to reduce spikes is to cut out things like sugar and flour and white rice. You can still have carbs such as starchy veg and whole grains if you combine them with fiber. So brown rice and beans. Potatoes in a lentil dish. Always add a non-starchy veg like broccoli, spinach, like that. You will still get all the sugar out of the carbs but it will come out slowly not in a quick spike. Think of it like this, do you get to work faster when there's no traffic or when everyone else is on the road? The fiber and fat tie up your digestion and just plain get in the way and slow things down so all the sugar doesn't come out at once. This is why when in a hypo crisis we have to have pure sugar so it gets in our systems fast. IMHO the best foods are whole grains, beans/legumes, veg and fruit with some healthy fat from nuts and avocados. Saturated fat is bad bad bad. That's what builds up in the cells and starts insulin resistance. Everyone is different so testing often or having a monitor really helps. Can you have a cookie or piece of cake? Sure, just have it with a meal and cut down on the other carbs. Some things are better than others. If I have corn my numbers go through the roof no matter what I do. So when I can't resist a fresh ear of corn I have a plate of beans and veg and take my lumps. Frequent exercise is a lifesaver, not just for weight loss but it reduces insulin resistance. It helps to get the fat out of your muscle cells so they respond better to insulin plus if you deplete the stored sugar in your cells there's a mechanism that allows the sugar in that doesn't need insulin. It's a win-win. I hope you found this helpful.",AITA for walking home because my brother-in-law wouldn’t let me eat in his car?,Unknown,Positive,None

You will receive negative attention during your campaigns for having one. Go to university and major in political science or criminal justice. If it’s not there back out of the app and go back in. After graduating, go to law school, and be a lawyer for 10 years. After 10 years of being a lawyer, start as a mayor (honestly school board director is just pointless). Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Because you have 6 different platforms as mayor, allocate 9 hours every week to each platform. This makes 54 hours a week, and will increase your approval rating. I would suggest doing two terms as mayor. Then you want to go for governor. Again, because you have 6 platforms, allocate 9 hours to each. After two terms as mayor and two terms as governor, you should be in your mid-50s. At this point, you want to budget 100-200 million for your presidential campaign. However, if you can’t get that much, I would suggest 80 million at least. You need to really pay attention to the questions for this campaign. Hopefully, you will win the election. To keep your popularity as President, do speeches and rallies. Because there is 9 platforms as President (ignore golf completely), allocate 6 hours to each. This will help you win a second term.

"you have to advocate for yourself. when my last child was born they were trying to force me into a c-section. I had to shop around until I found a provider that would allow for a VBA2C. Then I lost my insurance four weeks before my child was due and I had to fight like hell to find another dr that was ok with a VBA2C. I heard very good reviews about a particular hospital that was most likely to trial VBACs and I went there. I had my first appointment and was scheduled to be induced for a trial of labor within three days. I was able to avoid a third c-section. I have had people in the hospital actually call CPS on me because they never bothered to check that I was actually being cared for by Drs for a chronic disease I had and they insisted my child take meds that he did not need, and I had to fight them to allow me to be released with my son. When CPS investigated, they asked me why they were called and pretty much told me the case was bs. Most of my experiences were negative. If not for the chronic disease (and the nonavailability of an epidural), I would probably much rather not bother with going to a hospital at all. I had to do a lot of research and fighting for them to actually make good decisions. Granted I'm not a dr, but when they would recommend a certain treatment or course of action, I always had to question why they were recommending it, ask them if they really thought it was the best choice of action, and have them justify why.

Giving us more symptoms, sticking around longer, or proving fatal. So all we can do is try to add as many things to the not as severe an outcome side of scale. We can try to mitigate the amount of Viral Load, by masking, social distancing, ventilation. We can try to give our bodies everything possible to be prepared, stay current on vaccines, have sufficient rest, VitD levels.

"You are absolutely NTA for getting him to sort out his own meals because he sounds like a jerk. It also sounds like you are unsure how to cater to a diabetic. If you are indeed still planning on getting married, this will be a major hurdle. You cant eat separately your whole life together.

This will become an integral part of your lives unless he is type 2 and seriously changes his lifestyle, which is not on you. Some tips, if you want them. Cook the food you used to cook. BUT Swap out your rice for unseasoned, not oiled brown rice. Avoid putting salad dressings on your salads. Salads are great. You can and absolutely should eat salads. You dont need dressing! You should Avoid excess oils (including cream and butter). Don't coat your proteins in batter and unnecessary crumbs. Swap out refined carbs for wholegrains in things like bread and muffins.

I had always worked outside the home and I took this flex work opportunity as my current work travel time was 2.5 hours one way. During my time as a remote worker my oldest son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes so this just cemented the fact that remote work would be best for our family. Additionally, in the state where I live childcare is a mortgage payment so trying to financially sustain would have been a strain, so I also work at home with my now 2 yr old. Working from home with a toddler is hard,I am a project manager for a utility company so my job is demanding at times, but I make it work. During a meeting one day that my husband was home (he works outside the home but has off two days during the week), my son had climbed on top of one of his toys and was trying to touch our TV, I was on a zoom so I motioned for my husband to come over and grab him. I thought it was no big deal but the meeting lasted about an hour. After the meeting my husband was visibly upset when I asked him if he was annoyed he at first denied it but then eventually told me he's worried I'm neglecting our toddler during the week. I was offended and hurt, I told him that he works outside the home so he would never understand trying to juggle being mom full time and being a full time employee from the same place; that I took the remote work so it would help us financially and to make sure someone was here for our oldest who's diabetic. He told me him working outside the home wasn't his choice and I need to just take his criticism and understand I'm not being attentive to our son during the week. I told him that if he really cared he would be helping me when I'm working and he's off, he told me because I don't ask him, it's my fault he can't read my mind, that even on the weekends I neglect my son because I have to clean the house. I stood my ground on the fact that working from home with a toddler is tremendously difficult and if he thinks that I need to neglect my job so I can make him feel better; he could quit his job. (the only reason I said hun is because my salary is higher). He said throwing my salary in his face and making him feel less doesn't negate the fact that our son is suffering because of my need to put work before him. I think I'm doing everything I need to to make sure I am doing the best I can to juggle both roles as it is my responsibility to work and raise children. I'm still very upset and concerned that I am the asshole and actually responsible for making my toddler suffer. *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

"Hi Everyone, Here's some quick background. I am, 30 years old with about 10 years of experience ins customer support and marketing. I'm about 3 months from finishing an Environmental Studies degree which I used to take as much physical science as possible, but still had a well-rounded experience with a lot of sociology as well. While I'm not sure of my desired career path (going through a lot of self-discovery lately) an internship opened up for my state equivalent to the EPA. The position is under a Dr. I've worked with in the past and we have a good relationship. While nothing is guaranteed, I have a good shot at securing this internship, but this is where my questions begin. As someone with 10 years of experience in another field, my brain is resistant to taking an internship, while it's paid, it's unbenefited. I would likely have to continue working my part-time job, along with the full-time internship to cover health insurance (I'm a type 1 diabetic, it's $$$) and other stuff. My real question is how valuable is an internship at this stage in my career? Given that I'm almost graduating, but have little actual experience in this field beyond academics and undergraduate ecology research, would I be in a good position to get hired on with a full-time position in conservation or something adjacent or is the internship a good call in this situation.

"# 20pc of secondary school students are obese: Survey ^(February 2, 2023) [View Images](https://imgur.com/a/ZKGZ16I) James Kon Findings from the Global School-based Student Health Survey 2019 among teenagers aged 13 to 17 has shown that one in two teenagers are overweight or obese. Meanwhile, the rate of obesity among secondary school students is around 20 per cent. Routine monitoring on the status of obesity among children aged six to 13 showed a worrying trend since 2009 whereby the trend has increased by one point every year. This is not surprising, given that only 11.5 per cent meet the recommended level of physical activity and as many as 33.6 per cent drink one or more canned drinks, which have a high sugar content, every day. The Health Promotion Centre (HPC) organised a workshop on school’s initiatives in health promotion for primary and secondary private schools in Brunei-Muara and Belait districts. Sixty-one teachers from 35 private schools attended the two-day workshop which concluded on Tuesday. The concept of school health promotion, disseminating findings from the Global School-based Student Health Survey 2019, Global Youth Tobacco Survey 2019 and Health Promoting Schools Survey 2016 as well as sharing information and plans in implementing the pilot programme of School Health Promotion in the Sultanate were among the objectives introduced during the workshop. It also aimed at discussing existing health-related policies and health promotion activities implemented in schools and to devise a school health promotion action plan suitable for students and to support the achievement in the main goal of the World Health Organization (WHO): Making Every School a Health-Promoting School. According to research, children especially teenagers are vastly exposed to the risk factors of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) impacting their health when they become adults. These include cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. Four risk factors for NCD identified in children and teenagers are an unbalanced diet, tobacco use, alcohol use and lack of physical activity, according to WHO in 2017. Meanwhile, other health indicators also show an alarming rate where nearly 20 per cent of secondary school students have reported having suicidal thoughts in the past 12 months and 12.2 per cent have attempted suicide. Additionally, 23.7 per cent of secondary school students reported that they had been bullied in the previous 30 days, while 31.1 per cent reported sustaining a serious injury within the past 12 months. To help reduce the rate, the WHO has introduced the school health promotion concept which uses the ‘whole-school-approach’ method to promote health and educational achievement to school members by using the school’s potential to create a more conducive learning environment. The concept does not start from scratch or by adding to the existing curriculum or education programme, but utilises and strengthens existing capacity or resources to improve the existing initiatives in promoting a healthy lifestyle and providing a safe learning environment. The approach has been proven to show a positive effect on health, including an increase in physical activity, eating a balanced diet, reducing violence at school and abuse of prohibited substances. With such workshop, the participants have the opportunity to discuss interactively and share thoughts and experiences to improve the effectiveness of the Health Promoting School model and absorbed into schools nationwide. *** ^([ )[^(Give feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=brunei_news_bot) ^( | )[^(Code)](https://github.com/dsychin/RedditBruneiNewsBot) ^( | )[^(Changelog)](https://github.com/dsychin/RedditBruneiNewsBot/releases) ^( ] v0.5.1)",20pc of secondary school students are obese: Survey,Unknown,Neutral,"""Obesity"", ""Cardiovascular"", ""Diabetes"""

"> I'd also really appreciate if you would exclude the condescending tone Alright, im sorry. The idea that carbs are not essential comes from gluconeogenesis - your body makes all the glucose it needs from non-glucose sources. This is how people can fast for 30+ days. (not that im saying you *should* fast for 30 days, im just pointing out that you *can*). Note: i never said you don't need *blood glucose*. I said you don't need carbs (dietary glucose). Your entire body uses glucose independent if you consume them or not. Your body has the ability to strike a perfect balance between blood glucose and ketones. This creates perfect blood sugar control. Apart from 30 day fasting, another example is the carnivore diet. This is a diet where people eat exclusively meat only. These people go without carbs indefinitely. They just drop carbs and build muscle, and they feel fine. Done it myself. (again, not saying you *should*, just saying you *can*) >in diabetics, can cause diabetic ketosis There seems to be some confusion regarding diabetic ketoacidosis (not ""diabetic ketosis""). This happens only when a diabetic reached end stage insulin resistance. The cell can not accept any more glucose. The body thinks its starving, so it produces ketones. And this ultimately kills the diabetic. The irony in all of this is that people reverse their diabetes by giving up carbs. >My years of professional education as well as my colleagues, instructors, body builders, and nutritionists Ive worked with would greatly disagree as well.

I work full time at home as does he. He has decided he wants to lose weight which is harder because of his disability and I try to cook healthy meals since I have T2 diabetes and so does my mother, but I don't follow a specific diet at this point , just try to keep my carbs down and eat my veggies. My husband has decided he wants to do Keto. Its ok as I usually have a meat and can work around this, but sometimes its hard. I can make a salad and extra veggies for my mom and I. I do nearly all of the cooking and sometimes,when tired, we order delivery. His Keto requirements are causing me some extra stress because I now have a pantry full of food he can't eat (that he liked previously), he doesn't like salad and most veggies , so eggs, meat and cheese is about his only option. I bought some keto bread so he can have a sandwich for lunch. The issue comes in on times like last night, I made stuffed manicotti ( Sam's club pre-made) and then I had to prepare a whole separate meal for him . The entire point of me using a pre-made meal was so I could rest and not have to cook. AITA for not wanting to cook separate meals?

"When one is over 60 health issues can interact and accumulate. So there is no one answer. A diabetes (type ll) diagnosis prompted me to attack my poor health with diet changes. I used a nutritionist that I met with 2 or 3 times as needed. The approach was ""Low Carb"". I counted carbs and lost 55-60lbs. So that works for some people. I looked in the mirror after that and saw a lot of ""sag"". So I started at the gym-local YMCA. While trainers are not cheap, I used one twice a week for 30 minutes and exercised in the gym on my own. The nutritionist was very helpful. In the end this is about not diet or about exercise but really about LIFESTYLE change-yes you can throw stop smoking into this too. Later in my quest for a more healthy lifestyle, I went to a Whole Food Plant Based diet. This didn't last but a year or so-it's hard to maintain with others in the household not being engaged in the same. I will tell you it may be the most healthy option of all. Finally, with some weight creep-I put on some pounds... I have used an app My Net Diary to log everything I eat AND get 'credits' from exercise that allow me to eat more and still lose weight.

"Big of a long one, sorry...though this is just one story of MANY from that toxic relationship. I'll preface this by saying that when we met I was 22 and he was almost 34. Big gap? Yes, but I was more mature than him tenfold and already had a university degree, college diploma and was living on my own working in a full time career. That being said, yes, the cliché is true that no woman his age would date him...and here's just one reason why: He lost his job the week before our wedding (laid off with cause because he was drinking on the premises - a garage - with coworkers) - five years into our relationship - but insisted we proceed with the wedding HE wanted and not cancel (I would have been happy to go to city hall but he wanted a *real* wedding to the tune of $22k). We paid for the wedding on credit to get points but had the money to pay it off almost immediately as we both had decent jobs and very few expenses - of course this was before he lost his job making around $60k/year, so paying off the credit was no longer an option. He never worked again a single day of our marriage (3 years) despite me struggling to pay our bills, the minimum credit card payment ($800/month and the bank refused to help in any way) and BEGGING him to find work. Oh wait - he did pretend to have a job once but turns out he was just going to a bookstore nearby and reading all day... I found out when I called his job during a medical emergency (fainted on public transit from stress/low blood sugar) and they had no idea who he was. The final straw, however, was that he decided to go on a 5 week trip with his b\*tch of a mother to their home country and extended the trip by two weeks while he was away - lying to me about his return date right up until the day he was meant to come back. He didn't tell me because it meant he'd miss my 30th birthday, which was also my dad's 60th (we share a bday) and he ""knew I'd be mad"". When he came back I was already 90% out the door mentally but the final nail was that I had been squirreling away money in an account while he was gone and didn't tell him. I logged into the account one day and all the money was gone. He'd found my cheques, figured I had a secret account and was able to write a cheque for the majority of the funds (he didn't know how much I had, but I guess he got lucky) and sent all my money to his baby mama that he hadn't been paying child support to for years because, you know, he had no job. I went to the bank to see the cashed cheque and saw the baby mama's name on it. I kicked him out that day to go live with his mother (luckily we had no assets together and no kids) but he left the country within a few months and I was saddled with 100% of the credit card debt (if you'll recall - the entirety of our wedding costs at $22k, 19% interest). At 30 I took our dog and two cats and moved to another city to my own apartment. Divorced him (served his mother with the papers since I had no idea how to contact him), managed to pay off all the debt within a few years, eventually met an amazing man (going 10 years strong!) and spent the better part of my 30s traveling the world. Two of the places I visited were countries he'd always wanted to visit himself (Iceland and South Africa) and damn, that was satisfying.

Anyone that doesn’t think people abused companies like Cerebral for fake diagnoses of ADHD is delusional. I have 17 people in my cohort of 160 nursing students who did just that. They brag about it. One girl won’t shut up because she lost 45lbs since she started using (abusing) adderal. This type of shit is what really hurts people with ADHD.

They saw an easy way to make money and jumped at the opportunity. They didn’t care who got hurt in the process or the long-term consequences. Money was the bottom line. ADHD should not be diagnosed with a simple telehealth or office visit either. There are other mental health issues with overlapping symptoms. There is a reason there is specific testing for ADHD. My best friend was diagnosed with ADHD at 23. She was prescribed Ritalin and the first day she took it she jumped out a second story window. Why did she do that? Because she actually has severe bipolar and Ritalin pushed her hypomania right into full blown mania.

"Typically visceral fat is used to describe adipose tissue around the other organs (intestines etc), and or the hypertrophy of the greater omentum which hangs in front of the abdomen like an apron (as is often described). This happens for a variety of reasons, eating too much too often can do it, the same for eating foods that produce a strong insulin response because the create a very sharp rise in blood sugar like refined sugar and all of its derivatives. I believe the culprit more often than not is fructose or alcohol as both do the same thing to the liver, which is force fat deposits on it, which creates some metabolic dysfunction down stream eg hyperinsulinemia aka insulin resistance. All of which are precursor to type 2 diabetes. Much of this can be reversed/ put into remission) (like greater than 90%) by incorporating strategies that restore insulin sensitivity. You can do this through CICO and limiting your exposure refined carbs (including sugar) You can do this through intermittent fasting, you can find a protocol to your liking, the idea is that while fasting, blood sugar and subsequently insulin have a chance to fall to within natural tolerances instead of constantly being elevated from eating every 4 hours. You can do this through Keto, which basically removes many insulin triggers from the diet. This achieves the same affect as intermittent fasting laying off booze is also very helpful YMMV With respect to exercise, you will want to lean into slow moderate heart rate stuff that you do for a long time that incorporates the whole body, like walking or swimming or dancing or whatever gets you there at for about 2 hours a week, the more the merrier You can also incorporate the use of a continuous glucose monitor, which can help you sort out which foods are elevating your blood sugar the strongest (this is particularly helpful if you don't eat sweets eg pinto beans trigger a strong reaction in some folks) To gain the best clarity talk with your primary care physician about what you are seeing and if they think it could be diabetes they will have a look at your blood panels and give your their expert opinion.",What is visceral fat and how do I get rid of it?,Unknown,Positive,"""Diabetes"", ""Type 2 Diabetes"""

"Well…????‍♀️ Beats me lol I’m a loss and as you see you will find mixed opinions on the matter from both research and individuals with the disease. All I can do is speak on myself and tell you what I’ve experienced as a diabetic. So I ended up dropping a ton of weight within a year and was floating by with an a1c of 5.4 without any medication, but I originally started at 9. I wasn’t doing keto but stayed somewhat low carb by staying 100 or less each day. Tbh I was throwing back them fruity drinks like crazy and did do my fair share of restaurant food still so believe me when I say I was even surprised I was holding down some great a1c numbers. However, as a whole when thinking on my usual eating pattern, I was intaking much smaller food amounts per each meal, was moderately active, and weighing alot less. My fasting stayed under 100 and my meal spikes, even on the carb filled meals, were in fact a lot less sever than they were when I was diagnosed. Something like a burrito dinner, Chinese food, or pizza would easily have me sitting at 200-250 by the 2 hour mark and now those same meals only have me at a 160 max by 2 hours. The worst spike I’ve had within the past 6 months were an Olive Garden meal, cake, liquor, and ice cream all around the same time for a bday and I KNEW I was in for some serious damage. Ate so much I damn near threw up and blood sugar was about 177. High yes but i thought I was going to easily be around 300 because I had a serious carb overload. The truth of the matter is my insulin response is very different after making changes within my life and I’m pretty sure weight was the biggest contributing factor.
